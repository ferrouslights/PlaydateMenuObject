-- Name this file `main.lua`. Your game can use multiple source files if you wish
-- (use the `import "myFilename"` command), but the simplest games can be written
-- with just `main.lua`.

-- You'll want to import these in just about every project you'll work on.

import "CoreLibs/object"
import "CoreLibs/graphics"
import "CoreLibs/sprites"
import "CoreLibs/timer"
import "Menu"

-- Declaring this "gfx" shorthand will make your life easier. Instead of having
-- to preface all graphics calls with "playdate.graphics", just use "gfx."
-- Performance will be slightly enhanced, too.
-- NOTE: Because it's local, you'll have to do it in every .lua source file.

local gfx <const> = playdate.graphics

local menu = nil
local activeObjects = {}

-- A function to set up our game environment.

function myGameSetUp()
	menu = Menu(true, "main title", nil, "main")
end

-- Now we'll call the function above to configure our game.
-- After this runs (it just runs once), nearly everything will be
-- controlled by the OS calling `playdate.update()` 30 times a second.

myGameSetUp()

-- `playdate.update()` is the heart of every Playdate game.
-- This function is called right before every frame is drawn onscreen.
-- Use this function to poll input, run game logic, and move sprites.
function playdate.update()
	
	if menu ~= nil then
		menu:update()
	end

	gfx.sprite.update()
	playdate.timer.updateTimers()
